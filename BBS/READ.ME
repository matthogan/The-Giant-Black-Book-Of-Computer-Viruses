The BBS virus can be assembled with TASM or MASM. A86 is pretty brain-dead
here because it can't understand instructions of the form

                OFFSET X - OFFSET Y

The BBS.ASM file has include statements for FATMAN.ASM, INT13H.ASM and BOOT.ASM
so those have to be in the same directory as BBS.ASM when you assemble. The
result is a COM file loader that will put the virus on a floppy in A:.
